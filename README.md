## How It Works
The Harry Potter Quiz Game fetches character data from the Harry Potter API, and presents it to the player in the form of a quiz. The game includes questions about the actors who portrayed the characters in the series, their images, and other related data. The game uses a Tkinter-based user interface with Gryffindor-themed colors, and includes multiple-choice answers for each question.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Tkinter for the GUI
- requests library for API interactions
